# Smart-OOI
Smart Object Optical Inspection

This work is heavily based on the work done by Bob Baddeley - but ported to Python 3, and re-written so I understand it :)
His work can be found at: http://www.bobbaddeley.com/2015/12/06/creating-an-automated-optical-inspector-for-50/

His work was on done on Python 2.7 and, for a good programmer, is pretty well documented.
Some of us are poor programmers, but are willing to give it a shot.

So I've re-written, borrowed, hacked etc to try and make it a little more usable.

Current version only does the masking (and creating masks etc).

Please contribute if you have better skills than me!
